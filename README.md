# Leaker
Checks any potential secrets in file of .js based on regex (Not very good, to many false positives)
This is very shit.

# Usage
edit the python script "with open" directory location as this is mine.
Results will be written in leakcreds.txt (change directory)
Change the regex.json directory to where you cloned the repo and saved it.

python3 leaker.py
Path to JSfiles: /home/hackershiv/targets/js.txt (needs to be full path)

Results will be saved, not displayed.
